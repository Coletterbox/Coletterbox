### Hi!
#### Here's a list of stuff.

[Here's a guide to Git that I wrote because of being in multiple environments where all Git-related queries, some with only the most tenuous link, were directed to me.](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Git-Guide)

[Here's some light data analysis using Python (including NumPy and Matplotlib), created on a day when I couldn't think of a project idea that wasn't a joke.](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Text-Comparison)

[This is... let's call it social commentary. It's a word cloud and some other stuff using Python and some of its libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib...](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Analysis-of-Some-Guy-s-Attempt-at-Small-Talk)

These are my Advent of Code attempts, but every year I stop around Christmas Day (but so does everyone else I know). [2020](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Advent-of-Code-2020) [2021](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Advent-of-Code-2021) [2022](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Advent-of-Code-2022)

[This is a web page I made that randomly chooses your next task, in case you can't decide (JavaScript, HTML and CSS, of course).](https://coletterbox.github.io/Random-Task-Chooser/)

[This... I was so proud of this until I realised how redundant it was. Basically if you need to run an SQL query for a range of dates and plot the results, all you need to do is input a few things as arguments, and it handles all that for you. Just like... many existing programmes already do. Oh well!](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Run-and-Plot-an-SQL-Query-for-Multiple-Dates/blob/main/Run%20and%20Plot%20SQL%20Query%20For%20Multiple%20Dates.ipynb)

[This connects to BigQuery's API; runs queries (that I wrote) and plots them using Python libraries.](https://github.com/Coletterbox/More-BigQuery-with-Python/blob/main/dashboardDraft1.ipynb)
