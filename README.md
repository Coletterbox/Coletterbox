### Hi!
#### Here are (some of) my completed projects (that aren't confidential and/or the property of an employer).

[Here](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Git-Guide)'s a guide to Git that I wrote because of being in multiple environments where all Git-related queries, some with only the most tenuous link, were directed to me.

[This](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Link-Tallying) analyses the frequency of each company advertising on a given marketplace (Python, Matplotlib...) by taking the HTML file as an input.

[Here](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Text-Comparison)'s some light data analysis using Python (including NumPy and Matplotlib), created on a day when I couldn't think of a project idea that wasn't a joke.

[This](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Analysis-of-Some-Guy-s-Attempt-at-Small-Talk) is... let's call it social commentary. It's a word cloud and some other stuff using Python and some of its libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.).

These are my Advent of Code attempts, but every year I stop around Christmas Day (but so does everyone else I know). [2020](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Advent-of-Code-2020) (Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby and C#), [2021](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Advent-of-Code-2021) (JavaScript) and [2022](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Advent-of-Code-2022) (Python).

[This](https://coletterbox.github.io/Random-Task-Chooser/) is a web page I made that randomly chooses your next task, in case you can't decide (made using JavaScript, HTML and CSS, of course).

[This](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Run-and-Plot-an-SQL-Query-for-Multiple-Dates/blob/main/Run%20and%20Plot%20SQL%20Query%20For%20Multiple%20Dates.ipynb)... I was so proud of this until I realised how redundant it was. Basically if you need to run an SQL query for a range of dates and plot the results, all you need to do is input a few things as arguments, and it handles all that for you. Just like... many existing programmes already do. Oh well!

[This](https://github.com/Coletterbox/More-BigQuery-with-Python/blob/main/dashboardDraft1.ipynb) connects to BigQuery's API; runs SQL queries (that I wrote) and plots them using Python libraries.

[This](https://github.com/Coletterbox/MergeSort/blob/master/CombineAndSortArrays.java) is a merge sort project I completed in Java.

[This](https://github.com/Coletterbox/SudokuCheckerJava/blob/master/src/main/java/com/test/crss/CheckBoard.java) (in Java) takes a sudoku board as a two-dimensional array and tells you if it is complete/correct.

[This](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Sudoku-Checker/blob/master/sudoku1.js) is the same sudoku checker in JavaScript. I wrote it first (in the language that I knew better), and then knowing that the logic worked, I was able to rewrite it in another language, just focusing on the syntax. This is my way of picking up new languages quickly.

[This](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Multiplying-Numbers-as-Strings/blob/master/script.js) multiplies numbers as strings (in JavaScript) to avoid conversion to scientific notation.

[This](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Slightly-Bigger-Numbers) takes a number and returns the next biggest number that uses the same digits. I may have gone too far back... The code might be terrible. But it works! (JavaScript.)

[This](https://coletterbox.github.io/headline-generator) (using HTML, CSS and JavaScript) is a parody of racist, fearmongering newspapers. It generates headlines randomly, just like they do.
