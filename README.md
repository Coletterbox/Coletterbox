# Hi!

## Some of My Completed Projects (that aren't confidential and/or the property of an employer):

----

### Data Analysis

[Solutions to SQL Puzzles from the Internet](https://github.com/Coletterbox/SQL-Server-Problems) - Specifically HackerRank. (SQL Server)

[Advent of SQL 2024](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Advent-of-SQL-2024) - (Topics covered: JSON, case, joins, union, CTE, ASCII, string aggregation, window functions.) These are generally a lot more complex than the HackerRank intermediate problems, since they involve JSON and XML data. The author has marked them all as "beginner," which I'm thinking may be a sick prank. (PostgreSQL)

[Marketplace Analysis](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Link-Tallying) - This analyses the frequency of each company advertising on a given marketplace by taking the HTML file as an input, since there was no API for this section of the marketplace. (Python, Matplotlib...) 

[Data Analysis (BigQuery and Python)](https://github.com/Coletterbox/More-BigQuery-with-Python/blob/main/dashboardDraft1.ipynb) - This connects to BigQuery's API; runs SQL queries (that I wrote) and plots them using Python libraries.

[More Data Analysis](https://github.com/Coletterbox/A-Google-Sheets-Dashboard) - This is going to be a dashboard project, but right now it's a sandbox (Python - connects to API; gets data; uses Pandas, MatPlotLib and NumPy).

[A Programme Which Runs and Plots SQL Queries for Inputted Date Ranges](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Run-and-Plot-an-SQL-Query-for-Multiple-Dates/blob/main/Run%20and%20Plot%20SQL%20Query%20For%20Multiple%20Dates.ipynb) - I was so proud of this until I realised how redundant it was. Basically if you need to run an SQL query for a range of dates and plot the results, all you need to do is input a few things as arguments, and it handles all that for you. Just like... many existing programmes already do. Oh well!

[Text Analysis (this is not serious)](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Text-Comparison) - Some light data analysis using Python (including NumPy and Matplotlib), created on a day when I couldn't think of a project idea that wasn't a joke.

[Word Cloud from WhatsApp Data](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Analysis-of-Some-Guy-s-Attempt-at-Small-Talk) - This is... let's call it social commentary. It's a word cloud and some other stuff using Python and some of its libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.).

----

### General Code Things (e.g. web development and coding puzzles)

[Git Guide](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Git-Guide) - A guide to Git that I wrote because of being in multiple environments where all Git-related queries, some with only the most tenuous link, were directed to me.

[Advent of Code 2024](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Advent-of-Code-2024)

Previous Advent of Code Attempts: [2020](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Advent-of-Code-2020) (Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby and C#), [2021](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Advent-of-Code-2021) (JavaScript) and [2022](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Advent-of-Code-2022) - But every year I stop around Christmas Day (but so does everyone else I know). (Python)

[Randomised Task Chooser Website](https://coletterbox.github.io/Random-Task-Chooser/) - A web page I made that randomly chooses your next task, in case you can't decide (made using JavaScript, HTML and CSS, of course).

[Merge Sort Project](https://github.com/Coletterbox/MergeSort/blob/master/CombineAndSortArrays.java) - A merge sort project that I completed in Java.

[Java Sudoku Checker](https://github.com/Coletterbox/SudokuCheckerJava/blob/master/src/main/java/com/test/crss/CheckBoard.java) - This takes a sudoku board as a two-dimensional array and tells you if it is complete/correct.

[JavaScript Sudoku Checker](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Sudoku-Checker/blob/master/sudoku1.js) - The same sudoku checker in JavaScript. I wrote it first (in the language that I knew better), and then knowing that the logic worked, I was able to rewrite it in another language (Java, above), just focusing on the syntax. This is my way of picking up new languages quickly.

[Multiplying Numbers as Strings](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Multiplying-Numbers-as-Strings/blob/master/script.js) - Multiplies numbers as strings (in JavaScript) to avoid conversion to scientific notation.

[Just an Old Solution to a Puzzle](https://github.com/Coletterbox/Slightly-Bigger-Numbers) - This takes a number and returns the next biggest number that uses the same digits. I may have gone too far back... The code might be terrible. But it works! (JavaScript.)

[Random Headline Generator](https://coletterbox.github.io/headline-generator) - This (using HTML, CSS and JavaScript) is a parody of racist, fearmongering newspapers. It generates headlines randomly, just like they do.
